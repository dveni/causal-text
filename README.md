# causal-text
This is a package for computing the causal effects of text. Concretely this means algorithms for quantifying the degree of influence some user-defiend property (E.g. sentiment, respect) has on an outcome (email reply time), while controlling for potential confounds (topic, etc). 

## Quickstart

Follow these commands to run the full CausalText algorithm on a simulated dataset.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --run_cb
```

## Usage




if not simulate:
	text
	Y
	C
	T_proxy
	T_true (optional)
